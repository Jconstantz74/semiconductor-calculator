        <h1 class="headline">Here's a look at how government incentives drive where new fabrication plants are built.</h1>

      <h4 class='byline'>By Jo Constantz | April 13, 2021</h4>
      <p>Automakers like Ford and GM have been forced to shut down factories due to a shortage of semiconductors, a key part that underlies much of our modern technology. These shortages have brought supply chains for semiconductors and other
        critical materials and products to the fore, with many calling for more domestic production to create more resilient supply chains and ensure supply in times of crisis. Semiconductors are critical to all of our modern technology, the demand
        for much of which is expected to soar in the coming decades: Consumer technology (our iPhones, laptops, etc.), national security (defense technology and advanced weapons systems), and the growing renewable energy sector (including electric
        vehicles, wind and solar technologies).</p>

      <p>Part of what makes the semiconductor shortage so devastating for the auto industry is that semiconductors, unlike lower-tech manufactured parts like seatbelts and tires, require an extremely high degree of specialization and precision to
        produce. The fabrication plants, or "fabs," are tremendously expensive to build and operate, so supply companies can't easily ramp up production to accomodate surges in demand. The total operating cost of a new fab can cost $20 billion,
        factoring in capital expenditure (upfront land, construction, and equipment) plus ten years of operating expenses (labor, utilities, materials, taxes).</p>

      <p>China and other East Asian countries (like Taiwan and South Korea) heavily subsidize their semiconductor manufacturing industry. The U.S. does not. According to a report by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) and Boston Consulting
        Group (BCG), government incentives
        account for 40–70% of differences in total operating costs. Approximately 15–40% of the
        difference in TCO between the U.S. and alternative locations is due to structural disadvantages in the cost of two factors: labor and utilities. Some countries further promote their domestic semiconductor-iindustry ecosystems by building the
        supporting infrastructure around fab locations at no cost to the semiconductor producer. easing regulations, simplifying or expediting procedures, and/or providing convenient locations.
